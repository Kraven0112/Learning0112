    <h1>Event loupe is asynchronous operation in javscript.</h1>
    <h2>call stack is mechanism in javascript provided by web browser to track the functions which is running and which can be executed first.</h2>
    <h2>setTimeout(function(){}) and setTimeout(function xyz(){}) the main difference between these two ways are reuse of function.</h2>
    <h2>If we use anonymous function we cannot reuse it anywhere, because it will be specified for where it is declared.</h2>
    <h2>If we use named function we can reuse it anywhere according to its scope.</h2>
    <h2>So the use of event loop is to push the operation from callback queue to call-stack</h2>
    <h2>All the promise related tasks are set in microtask queue.</h2>
    <h2>callback queue is also known as task queue.</h2>
    <h2>There are two types of task queue :> microtask queue and macrotask queue.</h2>
    <h2>microtask operations are like promises,mutation observers.</h2>
    <h2>macrotask operations are like setTimeout,setInterval,DOM events,Network requests</h2>
    <h2>In event loop microtasks get more priority than macrotasks while performing asynchronous operations.</h2>
    <h2>All the callback functions which come through promise are related to microtask-queue.</h2>
    <h2>microtasks have higher priority than macrotasks.</h2>
